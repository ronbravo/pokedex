# Pokedex

This is a simple example repo to test out working with multiple small frontend app. The desire is to build out a pokemon app using the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) as the data source. It seems like the [micro frontend architecture](https://micro-frontends.org/) may be the future of frontend development. So this repo is a means to experiment and put together research gleaned over the past year on the topic.

## Goals of Project

* Host everything inside one repo. This means branches for different micro apps that will contain their branches for:
  * features
  * releases
  * bug fixes
  * **NOTE:** Of course this could be extended to other kinds of branches but the above seem pretty common.
